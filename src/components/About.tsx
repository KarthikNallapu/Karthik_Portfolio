              Hello! I'm Karthik, a passionate developer and AI enthusiast from
              Telangana, India. I specialize in building smart, scalable, and
              interactive web applications with a focus on AI and data-driven
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              My journey in technology began during my undergraduate years at
              Hyderabad Institute of Technology and Management. I dove deep into
              Python, machine learning, and web development while working on
              real-world projects like an AI-Powered Career Counselor Website
              and a Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding Platform.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              With hands-on experience in freelancing, internships, and
              publishing research, Iâ€™ve continuously pushed my learning
              boundaries. I'm currently seeking exciting opportunities where I
              can contribute to innovative tech solutions and continue growing
              as a developer.
            </p>
